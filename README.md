### What is SvelteKit
SvelteKit is Svelte's take on the web application framework. This is the new (still in beta) official way to develop applications with Svelte. It is packed with features like routing, layouts, stage management, API routes, SSG, and SSR. If you come from React or Vue world, SvelteKit is the counterpart of Nextjs or Nuxt.

SvelteKit helps you to make static sites, server-rendered sites, and even hybrid static/server-rendered apps. It delivers an outstanding developer experience and fast user experience like the Svelte philosophy describes.

In general words, SvelteKit is a tool to take your Svelte code and transform it into a node app or static files. You can consider Svelte as the underlying language and SvelteKit the set that brings the server-side and some options about how an application should be architected.

### What is MDX and MDsveX

## What is MDX and MDsveX?

[MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) is a combination of Markdown and JSX

An authoring format that allows the writer to write the well-known markdown format but also introduce dynamic content by using the power of JSX components

It takes a string of markdown and transforms it to a Javascript string (React or Svelte)

It basically allows you to consider a regular markdown file as a component opening the door to add working code into the markdown file.

The MDX parser will insert your custom components into the parsed result, you can even replace base elements like paragraphs, headings, and others HTML elements.

This allows you to have a better authoring experience and to create all of your content using your lovely markdown, but also empowering your content with rich media elements like interactive charts, alerts, or embed external content like youtube videos, images, etc.

[MDsveX](https://mdsvex.com/) is the answer from [Svelte ](https://svelte.dev)world to the same need of authoring rich media content using a powerful media like markdown. This is a markdown pre-processor for Svelte components, this preprocessor allows you to use Svelte components in your markdown, or vice versa. It supports all Svelte syntax and almost all Markdown

It uses  [remark](https://remark.js.org/) and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) so you can use several plugins to enhance your experience.

üëã I [Mat√≠as Hern√°ndez](https://matiashernandez.dev), father, developer, podcaster, writer and instructor.

I started my journey many years ago (even before jQuery became a thing), though this years I tried many different things but web developmet has always been my passion. During the last 10 years I officialy worked as "Softare Engineer" or "Developer" (the role name depends on the company ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) for many different projects. During this years I collected ideas, concepts and knowledge that I try to share in different mediums to help other developers to level up their careers.

I love what I do and I try to bring the same passion to the content creation trough courses at [egghead.io](https://matiasfha.dev/egghead), articles en [FreeCodeCamp](https://matiasfha.dev/fcces), [my blog](https://matiashernandez.dev), [Cloudinary](https://mediajams.dev/author/matias-hernandez) and other publicationss and also with my podcasts [Caf√© con Tech](https://www.cafecon.tech/) & [Control Remoto](https://www.controlremoto.io/) and finally thorugh my [newsletter](https://microbytes.dev).
